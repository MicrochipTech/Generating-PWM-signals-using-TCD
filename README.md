Generating PWM Signals Using TCD with High-Frequency Input

This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for TCD as described in 'Generating PWM Signals Using TCD with High-Frequency Input' document from Microchip. The repository contains an Atmel Studio Solution with multiple projects inside. Make sure you have the necessary tools:

    1. AVR128DA48 device (or the AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano board)
    2. Atmel Studio
    3. AVR128DA48 Device Packs

The following examples are inside this repository:

    1. TCD_One_Ramp_OSCHF
	2. TCD_Two_Ramp_PLL
